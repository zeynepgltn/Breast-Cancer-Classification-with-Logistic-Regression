# Breast-Cancer-Classification-with-Logistic-Regression
 

This project is a breast cancer classification model using Logistic Regression. The model predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on the given dataset.

## 🌟 Overview
This project utilizes the **`breast_cancer.csv`** dataset to build a Logistic Regression model that predicts cancer types. The script includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance validation using k-Fold Cross Validation

## 🚀 Features
- **Preprocessing**: Dataset split into training and testing subsets.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Core model to predict cancer type.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy Score
  - k-Fold Cross Validation for performance consistency.
